# 👋 Hi, I'm Ameya Kulkarni

🧠 I learn by building — small, useful projects that teach me something real.  
🐍 Mostly Python. Interested in data analysis, automation, and building beginner tools.

- **Expense Tracker** – A simple Flask-based tool to log and track spending  
- **Mini Tools** – To-do app, BMI calculator, basic image search, and more

## 📚 What I Focus On
- Learning **step-by-step**, not skipping the "why"  
- Writing beginner-friendly code that *actually works*  
- Exploring **data**, **logic building**, and some **web basics**
